## Hi 👋

I’m a full-stack developer focused on building real, production-ready products.

I have experience designing and shipping APIs, backend services, and user-facing applications across both web and mobile platforms. I enjoy working end-to-end — from data modeling and backend logic to frontend and mobile experiences.

### Tech stack
- C# / .NET
- React & React Native
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Azure

### What I work on
I’ve built and worked on full-stack systems involving:
- REST APIs and backend services
- Real-time features
- Authentication and authorization
- Data modeling and persistence
- Cloud deployment and infrastructure

### Goal
My goal is to build scalable, maintainable software that solves real problems and is actually used in practice.

Most of my active development happens in private and commercial repositories, which is reflected in my contribution activity.
