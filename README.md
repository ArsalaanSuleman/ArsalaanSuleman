## Hi

I’m a full-stack developer focused on building real, production-ready software.

I work end-to-end across backend, frontend, and mobile — designing APIs, building user-facing applications, and deploying systems that are meant to be used in practice.

### Tech stack

* C# / .NET
* React & React Native
* PostgreSQL
* Docker
* Azure

### What I work on

I’ve built and worked on full-stack systems involving:

* REST APIs and backend services
* Real-time features and event-driven updates
* Authentication and authorization
* Data modeling and persistence
* Cloud deployment and infrastructure

### Selected projects

Most of my active development happens in private or commercial repositories. Below are representative examples of what I’ve worked on:

* **Full-stack product platforms** – End-to-end systems with .NET APIs, PostgreSQL data models, and React or React Native frontends.
* **Real-time applications** – Features using live updates, event streams, and client synchronization.
* **API-driven systems** – Secure, well-structured APIs designed for scalability and long-term maintenance.
* **Cloud-deployed services** – Containerized applications deployed and maintained in Azure environments.

Public repositories here mainly serve as references or experiments, while my contribution activity reflects ongoing private work.

### Goal

My goal is to build scalable, maintainable software that solves real problems and holds up in production over time.

I value clear architecture, practical solutions, and systems that are easy to understand, operate, and extend.
